# Unorthodox-Mapping
A website where people can find housing based on their preferences and on their unorthodox choices. Do you want to live near restaurants that serves specific food, or do you want to live near locations with odd selection?
Well this project is focused on finding such location for you, and include prices, reviews, and images to help users make the choices.

# Getting Started
We'll be using MEAN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJs) along with javascript to design this website from front and back end. 

## In-Development - I'll return each day to add onto this readme.
